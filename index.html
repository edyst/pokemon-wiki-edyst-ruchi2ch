    <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h2>

    <p>Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as
      part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first games
      released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred
      as
      the "core series" by their developers</p>

        <li>
          <h4>Water</h4>
        </li>

        <li>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three
          starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Water is
          the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling
          creatures.</li>

        <li>Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the three
          starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Fire
          types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often
          a plus.</li>

        <li>Grass is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Water, which constitute the three
          starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.Grass is
          one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass
          moves.</li>

        </li>
        <li>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting out
          their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit
          Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.</li>

          million and most-downloaded in its first month of release. To date, it has grossed almost $2 billion in
          revenue
          and been downloaded 800 million times. Although no longer the global phenomenon it was in 2016, the game
          remains

    <h2 style="font-size: 45px;text-align: center;"> Q and A</h2>

    <p><strong> Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</strong>

        <ul>
          <li> We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu
            is
            essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu,
            mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity.
            Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers
            should
            be able to answer.</li>
          <li> Answer is Raichu</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but
            progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who
            emerge
            in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're
            presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at
            all is required.</li>
          <li> Answer is Master Ball</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the central gameplay aspect of the core series

        <p>Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type
          matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different
          multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.

            The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and
            were
            created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red
            and
            Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released
            sometime
            after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
            Green version was not released outside Japan
